# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
Heart Disease Prediction Model using ML
This analyzes the heart disease predictions using classification algorithms. These invisible patterns can be utilized for health diagnosis in healthcare data. Data mining technology affords an efficient approach to the latest and indefinite patterns in the data. The information which is identified can be used by the healthcare administrators to get better services. Heart disease was the most crucial reason for victims in the countries like India, United States.
In this project we are predicting the heart disease using classification algorithms. Machine learning techniques like Classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression are used to explore different kinds of heart-based problems.
Limitation
• The system will produce incorrect results if the user inputs incorrect data.
• Linear Regression Algorithm works on a straight line so it‘s not 100% accurate every time

About Dataset :

Age: The age of the patient.

Sex: The gender of the patient.

Chest pain type: A categorical attribute indicating the type of chest pain experienced by the patient. It has four possible values.

Resting blood pressure: The resting blood pressure of the patient.

Serum cholesterol: The serum cholesterol level in mg/dl of the patient.

Fasting blood sugar: Indicates whether the patient's fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl.

Resting electrocardiographic results: A categorical attribute representing the results of the resting electrocardiogram. It has three possible values.

Maximum heart rate achieved: The maximum heart rate achieved by the patient.

Exercise induced angina: Indicates whether the patient experienced angina (chest pain) induced by exercise.

Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.

Number of major vessels: Represents the number of major blood vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ranging from 0 to 3).

Thal: A categorical attribute indicating the thalassemia type of the patient. It has three possible values: 0 for normal, 1 for fixed defect, and 2 for reversible defect.

Target: The target column serves as the outcome variable and indicates the presence of heart disease in the patient. A value of 0 signifies the absence of heart disease, while a value of 1 indicates the presence of heart disease.
